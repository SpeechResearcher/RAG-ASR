edacc_EDACC-C34_3151	well that is nice i guess if we talk about the hobbies i tend to answer that question in a in such a way that that answer tends to answer this question too because watching tv i will say alongside involving myself in different sports is like the kind of hobby that i want to do or i have i have loved spending time in let us say playing cricket or football were 2 of my great hobbies in which i have spent some quality time that i always love to think about and other than that when i would you know return back from school after so many classes so i would just simply put my bag in a room and i would just simply turn on the tv tune into cartoon network and simply start watching those cartoons again and again though i would know what is going to happen next in the scene like i have watched those cartoons so many times but still i would simply love every time though the same episode would be repeated or let us say would be played again by a broadcast or transmitted again from that channel i would simply love to watch it i would enjoy it in the same way as though it is being you know played for the very 1st time so i loved watching cartoons of all types i remember there was one there were so many very funny kind of cartoons too that were you know tuned or that were broadcast or transmitted from this cartoon network channel like cow and chicken was one of those cartoons like i i still do not understand what is the point of that cartoon it was so funny i could not even get what those 2 characters were doing and they would simply love themselves as to their siblings so then there was i guess another one i am weasel that was another cartoon so they were so many but i think with the passage of time yeah i i started to find some good series as well when i i entered within my teens so i was happy to you know find some great series cartoon series such as the justice league that that was a very great series that i really enjoyed watching during my teenage then the he man and the masters of the universe that was another cartoon that i really loved watching so these were the good ones that i do remember and i am very happy other than that i guess when i was in my school you know in the beginning teenage so i watched the toonami series in which there were 2 cartoons i guess so one was beyblade beyblade series v force g revolution and then there were the digimons and the pokemon series so these were the few of the cartoons yeah i would say like a hobby i would watch these cartoons and i really enjoyed my time then the 2nd part of the question is do you still you know involve yourself in some hobby so i would say as i mentioned you know being active being physical is something that i like to do to keep myself fit healthy and active so i have been hiking during my childhood you know to simply lose weight because i have remained quite obese during my i had this you call it childhood fat so you know i have spent quite a lot of time in in hiking so to lose weight other than that i would say that i have played so many games now if i talk about the time that i simply spend so that is basically tennis tennis is the game that i really love to play i have been watching tennis since 20078 when i started to see federer and the way he simply plays with a racket as though it feels like as though there is a wand in his hand so he had so many nemeses like nadal and djokovic so they gave him a very tough time but still he managed to win 20 grand slams i am not saying he is the greatest he is like one of the greatest player of all times there are 2 other nadal and djokovic so they are also doing great let us say nadal has like won his 22nd grand slam singles title recently by winning the roland garros title so i would simply say yeah these 3 are the biggest players of all times making records the un unbeatable records i would say so i have the same kind of fire and i do enjoy playing tennis with my friends in the evening or sometimes before going to the university early in the morning so that is one of the hobbies that i you know love spending time in and with that i will say i guess we got a notification also that our meeting will close within 10 minutes time so because i do not have this upgraded version of zoom so i guess it is time to you know sum it all up we did have a very great conversation and i guess it will be quite useful for research and analysis so thank you very much f c 26 p 2 it was a lovely time talking to you and it is goodbye from my side also f c 26 p one signing out and p 2 signing out also thank you
